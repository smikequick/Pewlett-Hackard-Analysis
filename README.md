## **Project Overview**


### ***Purpose***
The manager of infamous technology company Pewlett Hackard is interested in better understanding who is closing in on their retirement. Specifically, the manager requested a query to gather information on the number of retiring employees by title and to identify the number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The team at Pewlett Hackard hope to leverage this data to better understand how the "silver tsunami" will impact the company's future.

## **Results**

First, data was extracted to better understand the number of staff members at Pewlett Hackard who will be retiring soon. Informationw as used about employee birth date and title to determine the number of staff members who are close to retirement, as illustrated in the table below.

Additionally, in order to stem the tide of oncoming retirees, Pewlett Hackard wanted to better understand who is primed to be a part of a mentorship program so there is continuity in knowledge once the volume of potential retirees commit to full retirement. The data that was used focused specifically on birth date (practically 10 years younger than the upcoming retiree base). This information is partially illustrated below.

***Key Takeaways***

1) There should be a focus on mentorship for Senior Engineers, as there are 29,414 employees on the brink of retirement.
2) Further analysis should be done around Senior Staff, what positions they make up, and the impact of 28,254 employees retiring would have.
3) Upon deeper inquiry, it appears that the number of staff eligible for mentorship is significantly lower than the number of staff retiring. 
4) Further analysis should be done to determine if the pool for mentorship should be expanded.

## **Project Summary**

**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

  As it stands, there will be approximately 90,398 rolls that will need to be filled if all employees who are eligible retire.

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

  The short answer is yes. With 90,398 employees eligible for retirement, there are only 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program (table below). The only concern from this is will there be enough employees to fill all of the positions that are vacated?
